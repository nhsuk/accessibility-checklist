## Developer Notes

### Ensure text styles can be overridden

Text should be clear and content should not be lost when people with visual impairments or dyslexia override the authors set spacing or font family. Increased spacing or a change of font family may help users to enable readability or increased reading speed. Fixed height containers of text will often break when text-spacing is changed. Use min-height instead.

#### Spacing technical details

Text should not overlap or get cut off and fit within its containing box.

Ensure spacing can be overridden to the following:

- Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size;
- Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size;
- Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size;
- Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.

## Testing Notes

### The current text spacing can be overridden without loss of content or functionality

In content implemented using markup languages that support the following text style properties, no loss of content or functionality occurs by setting all of the following and by changing no other style property:

- Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size
- Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size
- Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size
- Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.

Use the tools provided, does anything break or become hidden?

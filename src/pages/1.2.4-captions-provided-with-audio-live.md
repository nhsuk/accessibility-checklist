## Design Notes

### Ensure videos with audio have accurate captions

Live video content, such as webinars, web calls, web conferencing, live streams or talk, speeches, presentation, etc, live news broadcasts, or any live event with spoken words as part of the audio content, must have captions that are synchronised with the audio content of the video. 

## Developer Notes

None

## Testing Notes

### Captions are provided for video with audio

Captions are provided for all live audio content in synchronized media, except when the media is a media alternative for text and is clearly labeled as such

#### Steps to check — Captions
  - Identify video content
  - If video content has audio, confirm captions have been provided
  - Confirm if captions accurately convey audio information — including: sound effects, music and other significant background sound (e.g. laughter)
  - For closed captions, confirm the control to turn on /off is also accessible e.g. keyboard operable

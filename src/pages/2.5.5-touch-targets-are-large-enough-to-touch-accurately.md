## Design Notes

### Ensure touch areas are large enough

Make sure that touch targets are big enough and have enough distance from each other.

It should be easy to interact with all the touchable items in screen.

Aim for a minimum 44px square control size and ensure there's a small area between targets of inactive white space. This applies to buttons as opposed to text links (such as links in body copy or website footer).

Large, spaced out touch targets help users with larger fingers or users with a mobility impairment which affects fine motor skills.

## Developer Notes

Note that the active area can be enlarged on controls without the size of the visible target changing. CSS can be used to change the display mode or add padding to achieve desired results.

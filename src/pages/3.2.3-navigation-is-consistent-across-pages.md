## Design Notes

### Ensure repeated navigation is consistent across pages

The location and presentation of navigation should be consistent across web pages. This helps people who use screen magnifiers who may rely on visual clues and the consistent location of elements to find and interact with repeated content on a page. This also helps keyboard and screen reader users who benefit from consistency in order to efficiently navigate websites.

## Developer Notes

None

## Testing Notes

### Navigation is consistently ordered across pages

Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple pages occur in the same relative order each time they are repeated, unless a change is initiated by the user.

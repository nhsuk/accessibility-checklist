## Design Notes

None

## Developer Notes

### Ensure HTML meets accessibility parsing requirements

Make sure the HTML is free from markup errors that are known to cause issues in assistive technologies (such as incorrect nesting of elements, or duplicate ids).

#### Parsing requirements

- HTML elements have complete start and end tags
- HTML elements are nested according to their specifications
- HTML elements do not contain duplicate attributes
- Any ids are unique within a page.

This can be easily integrated as an automated checks along with other existing build /development processes. For example, using a parsing library from node package manager (NPM).

#### Information and tools

- [WCAG 2.1 parsing error bookmarklet](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2019/02/wcag-2-0-parsing-error-bookmarklet/)

## Testing Notes

### Elements have complete start and end tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not contain duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique

- Run page source code through an automated parsing tool

Check only for the follow **errors**:

- Incomplete start /end tags
- Issues with correct nesting of elements
- Duplicate attributes
- Duplicate IDs on elements

**Impact range:** Low

**Test type:** Semi-automated (results need checking)

**Tool:** [ARC Toolkit](https://www.paciellogroup.com/toolkit/) (Send DOM to validator) and then use the [WCAG 2.1 parsing error bookmarklet](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2019/02/wcag-2-0-parsing-error-bookmarklet/)

## Design Notes

### Non-standard components, complex widgets

Complexity is the enemy of accessibility. Where possible include simple, conventional HTML elements in designs over complex custom solutions.

For example, if a date is required from a form user then a simple text input generally provides better accessibility than a custom date picker. The reason being browsers can offer a more accessible experience for native HTML elements by default over custom components. As there's no consistent user interface presentation for custom components, they can also pose a usability challenge as they require a user to 'learn' how to use them.

In addition, avoid combining or nesting several interactions in one — such as housing a form with a range slider inside a modal window. This, again, is likely to lead to less accessible experiences for users and require more effort for developers and testers.

Where the solution calls for a complex widget to be designed, collaborate with developers and testers to ensure designs have the best chance of being accessible once built.

## Developer Notes

### Use standard controls, or ensure non-standard controls are correctly marked up using WAI-ARIA

Help assistive technologies understand and accurately describe custom functionality, such as accordions, tabs and custom form fields.

Follow standard, robust ARIA patterns for non-native patterns and components.

#### Information and tools:

- [ARIA: Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/)

## Testing Notes

### Non-standard controls are properly marked up using WAI-ARIA and thoroughly tested

Refer to the ARIA authoring practice information to check how to optimise components for screen readers and other assistive technology. For example, ensuring the expanded /collapsed states for an accordion are announced to non sighted users.

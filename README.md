# Accessibility Checklist

The accessibility checklist helps those involved in creating websites and mobile apps more accessible.

It contains information and guidance and is based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1</a>.

## How to view the checklist locally

The checklist is built using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), which requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

To run it locally:
- ensure Node and Eleventy are installed
- clone this repository or download it as a zip
- at the command line, enter the directory you have cloned the repository (or extracted the zip) and run `npm install`
- run `npm start`

The site should now be running at `http://localhost:8080`

If you can't run this site locally, you can [view the site here](https://nhsuk.github.io/accessibility-checklist/).
